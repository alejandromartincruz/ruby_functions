Two Ironhack exercises to learn ruby functions

##Word sorting

###Problem Description

###Examples

<pre><code>
  "Have a nice day." => ["a", "day", "Have", "nice"]
  "Fools fall for foolish follies." => ["fall", "follies", "foolish", "Fools", "for"]
  "Ruby is a fun language!" => ["a", "fun", "is", "language", "Ruby"]
</pre></code>

##Yummy!!! BACON!!!

Write a function using if, elsif, and else to do the following:

if the food is bacon, it should put “Yummy!!! BACON!!!”
if the food is spinach, it should put “Urgh…”
if it is anything else, it should put “Can I have some bacon on the side?”
